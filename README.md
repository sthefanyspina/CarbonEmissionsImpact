# CarbonEmissionsImpact
In this analysis, we aim to explore the impact of carbon emissions on global temperatures. 
The focus will be on identifying historical trends, detecting anomalies, and simulating potential future scenarios to understand how changes in COâ‚‚ concentrations influence temperature anomalies.
